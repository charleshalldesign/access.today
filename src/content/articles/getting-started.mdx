# Getting Started with Your Blog

Welcome! This template makes it easy to start blogging with Astro. You can write articles in Markdown or MDX, and they'll automatically appear on your site with full type safety and SEO optimization.

## Quick Start: Creating Your First Post

Follow these simple steps to create your first blog article:

### 1. Create a New File

Add a new `.mdx` or `.md` file in the `src/content/articles/` directory:

```bash
src/content/articles/my-first-post.mdx
```

### 2. Add Frontmatter

Every article needs frontmatter with the following fields:

```yaml
---
title: My First Blog Post
description: A brief description that appears in article cards and SEO meta tags
date: 2025-12-21
author: Your Name
draft: false
tags: ['tutorial', 'example']
coverImage: /images/my-cover.jpg  # Optional
coverImageAlt: Description of cover image  # Optional
---
```

**Required Fields:**
- `title` - Your article title
- `description` - Brief summary (used in SEO and article cards)
- `date` - Publication date in YYYY-MM-DD format

**Optional Fields:**
- `author` - Defaults to "Anonymous" if not specified
- `draft` - Set to `true` to hide the article (defaults to `false`)
- `tags` - Array of tags for categorization (defaults to empty array)
- `coverImage` - Path to cover image
- `coverImageAlt` - Alt text for cover image

### 3. Write Your Content

After the frontmatter, write your article using Markdown or MDX:

```markdown
# My First Post

Welcome to my blog! This is a paragraph with **bold** and *italic* text.

## Features

- Write in Markdown or MDX
- Full TypeScript type safety
- Automatic SEO optimization
- Beautiful article pages

## Code Examples

You can include code blocks:

```javascript
const greeting = 'Hello, World!';
console.log(greeting);
```
```

### 4. Preview Your Article

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your article will be available at:
- Individual article: `http://localhost:4321/article/my-first-post`
- Articles list: `http://localhost:4321/articles`

### 5. Publish

When ready to publish:

1. Set `draft: false` in the frontmatter (or remove it, as false is the default)
2. Commit and push your changes
3. Build and deploy: `npm run build`

## Working with Drafts

Keep articles hidden while working on them:

```yaml
---
title: Work in Progress
description: This article is not ready yet
date: 2025-12-21
author: Your Name
draft: true  # This article won't appear on the site
tags: ['draft']
---
```

## File Naming

The filename becomes the URL slug:
- `my-first-post.mdx` → `/article/my-first-post`
- `getting-started.mdx` → `/article/getting-started`
- `2025-review.mdx` → `/article/2025-review`

Use lowercase and hyphens for best results.
